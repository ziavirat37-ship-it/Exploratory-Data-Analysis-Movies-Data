Cleaning and Exploring Movies data for useful insights
The data shows netflix movies, when they are released, their actors, directors, budget, revenue and Gross. The data was in raw form and we performed the following steps after data import. We inspected the data and gather the basic information from the data. Afer that we started cleaning the data and first step we took was to properly capitalize the columns names and we did by using for loop. In the second step we looked for duplicate values and no values were found. In the third step, we looked for null values and there were some null values and we removed the values by dropna code. In fourth step, we changed the data type of Gross and Budget as there were too many decimels, we changed the data from floating to integers so the data looks good. In step five, we used value count in Genre and Ratings and also visualize the data using bar chart. In the last step we did some exploratory analysis and from the data we found out the following. 1. Movies with biggest budget, top five. 2. Movies with lowest budget top five. 3. Directors with highest and lowest ratings. 4. Movies with highest and lowest gross. 5. Actors with highest gross, movies produced by each country and movies produced each year. This not only cleaned the data but showed most of the important imnformation which can be used.
